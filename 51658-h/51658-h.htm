<h2 class="no-break"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>In placing this little book before the boys, and the public
in general, the author has endeavored to show up the
mystic art of stage performances as clearly as possible&mdash;explicitly
enough to enable the greenest amateur to erect
a stage in his own drawing-room, and to place before his
friends the accompanying plays in a manner that shall
give entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>The growth of private theatricals has been very large of
late years, but the one cry has been: “How can we get
up a home performance properly, and with as little expense
as possible?” Nothing easier, say I; and if my
reader will but follow the instructions herein after given,
I have not the slightest doubt that he will be fully able to
do all he desires in the home-circle in this mystic art; and
with this little prelude, we proceed at once to the work in
hand.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STAGE_AND_EFFECTS" id="THE_STAGE_AND_EFFECTS">THE STAGE AND EFFECTS.</a></h2>


<p>If the room in which the performances are to be given is
furnished with folding doors there will be no need of a
proscenium, but if not, any enterprising lad can, by means
of a few boards, rig up one to suit, and drape it with colored
muslin, to be bought for a few cents per yard at any
drygoods store. This done, a sheet may be tacked securely
across the top, with a heavy pole at the bottom to facilitate
its falling. Four rows of brass rings may next be
sewed at intervals of a foot apart, from the top of the curtain
to the pole at the bottom. Strings must then be fastened
upon this pole, brought up through the lines of rings,
and attached to a larger piece of twine running horizontally
across the top, and passing through a screw-eye in
the proscenium, leaving a long end to dangle down, handy
for the person who is to attend to the rising and falling of
the curtain. By simply pulling this piece of twine, the
drapery will be found to ascend in graceful folds, and at
the signal for descent, will drop easily by the weight of
the pole. In the following diagram <em>a</em> is the upper cord, <em>b</em>
the rings through which the others pass, <em>c</em> the dangling
end, <em>e</em> the pole at the bottom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_005.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="proscenium" />
</div>

<p>“Wings,” or side pieces, may be constructed by stretching
muslin over an ordinary frame of common wood, and
braced by a stout stick to the floor, thus completely obscuring
the performers after they have made their exits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Flats,” or scenes at the back, upon frames, to draw off
and on, will be found too difficult to use in drawing-rooms,
as they necessitate the use of grooves above for
them to slide in; therefore, I would suggest the use of
“drops”&mdash;that is, scenes working after the manner of the
curtain, and when drawn up, concealed behind the “borders,”
or straight rows of muslin, tacked horizontally
across the top, and forming the ceiling of the scene, when
completed.</p>

<p>In order that there shall be as little cost as possible in
furnishing the scenery, let one lad, who has a taste for
drawing, stretch the “drop” upon a bare floor (drawn
tightly and tacked to the boards), and then, take a wood,
a garden, or a parlor, and with a piece of charcoal, copy
the trees, etc., upon the muslin, and then paint them in to
the best of his ability. The same plan should be followed
with the “wings.”</p>

<p>Care should be taken, however, not to remove the paintings
from the floor until they are <em>quite dry</em>, and then
stretch them over the frames and fasten securely.</p>

<p>One set of “wings” should be braced firmly to the floor,
and when a change of scene is required, the “drop” may
be drawn up and the other “wings” slid in and rested
against the braced ones. Lamps may be placed on each
side of the proscenium, and if footlights are desired, a
board may be put across before the curtain, with several
lamps placed so as to shine directly upon the stage, while
the board prevents them from glaring upon the audience.</p>

<p>The effect can be heightened by a board with a row of
candles in tin plates to catch the wax, behind each “border,”
so that they may shine down upon the actors; but
this is both troublesome and dangerous, as the ceiling is
liable to be smutted, and a breath of air may blow the
dangling “borders” into the flame and produce a disastrous
effect.</p>

<p>This done, the stage may be set as the play requires.</p>

<p>Should the action require a storm, peas may be shaken
upon the head of a drum to imitate the rain, a sheet of
zinc will furnish thunder, and the effect of lightning may
be produced with no danger by filling an ordinary putty
blower with licopodium and blowing it into the flame of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
candle. (An article for doing this, and called the “flash-box,”
is used on the regular stage.)</p>

<p>Colored fires may be produced by following these directions:</p>

<p>These fires when used should be spread either upon a
tin pan, or an ordinary fire shovel, and ignited by means
of a piece of cotton cord soaked in oil, and forming a quick
match. When lit, it should be raised above the head, and
will cast a brilliant tinge upon every object. A pail of
water should, however, be handy, so that immediately
after using it can be plunged into it, as the stench from
the cinders is by no means pleasant. The above recipes
will furnish enough fire for several performances, and if
the trouble of making must be disposed of, they can be
bought in tins at all first-class drug-stores, or places where
fireworks are sold.</p>

<p>To represent breaking glass, rattle broken crockery in a
closed basket; breaking wood, place a few laths over a
couple of bricks, lay a heavy book upon them, and strike
the volume with force enough to smash the laths.</p>

<p>To imitate the sighing of the wind, draw a piece of silk&mdash;an
old dress, for instance&mdash;over the rough edge of a pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
board, or make a wheel, after the manner in which boys
make water-wheels, and turn this, with the silk hanging
over it&mdash;the effect will be found good.</p>

<h2><a name="DRESS" id="DRESS">DRESS.</a></h2>


<p>In dressing the characters, care should be taken to do it
neatly and securely, for to lose a portion of a costume,
often turns the most serious scene to ridicule; and besides,
a drawing-room audience is one of the most critical.</p>

<p>Ladies with light, airy dresses should not go too near to
the footlights, and those with long trains should be careful
of the manner in which they are swung around.</p>

<p>The gentlemen must not forget to remove their hats
when entering a parlor scene, unless the business of the
play requires otherwise; and on the other hand, care
should be taken to wear them in exteriors, unless, as before,
there should be some reason. In making up the costumes,
glazed muslin of various colors will be found quite
effective and extremely cheap, and of this, with a few
spangles and cheap gilt braid, very tasteful dresses may
be made for ancient dramas, Mexicans, Gypsies, fairies,
etc.</p>

<h2><a name="MAKING_UP" id="MAKING_UP">MAKING UP.</a></h2>


<p>The great secret of the entire illusion is the art of making
up properly.</p>

<p>For a Mexican, or a Gipsy, the face should be reddened
with vermilion, the eyebrows made heavy and extremely
black, heavy lines drawn under the lower lashes of each
eye, a line should be placed between the two brows, and a
rigid one from the corners of the lips. A wig with short
hair in front, and long, flowing locks behind, completes
the make-up.</p>

<p>For old age, whiten the face with drop chalk, draw the
“crow’s feet” around the eyes and mouth with a camel’s
hair pencil and India ink, wrinkle the brow, and placing
the pencil in the furrows, draw them from temple to temple.
The eyebrows should be chalked, and the upper eyelids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
reddened considerably, although, be governed in all
cases by the nearness of your audience and the brightness of
the lights. If a white or gray wig is not to be gotten, chalk
the hair in lieu, taking care to wash it thoroughly after
the performance. For grief, the make-up is much the same
as the former, with the cheeks sunken by a slight application
of burnt cork.</p>

<p>Mustaches and beards may be made of crape hair, to be
bought of any wig maker, and stuck on by an application of
pulverized gum-arabic; or, on the other hand, they may be
deftly drawn before a glass, by a camel’s hair pencil and
a piece of India ink. Negroes should be made up with
burnt cork and glycerine, taking care to draw out the lips
and eyes before filling in.</p>

<p>To make what is termed a “pug nose,” blacken the sides,
which gives the appearance of an enlarged nostril and a
decided upward turn.</p>

<p>To show the loss of teeth cover them with black wax,
and from the auditorium they will appear missing.</p>

<p>To enlarge the nose, or flatten the cheeks, gum on pieces
of cotton batting, and redden with vermilion.</p>

<p>In making up nicely, do not whiten the face <em>too much</em>,
and blend the colors neatly from the eyes to the cheeks by
means of a hare’s foot, or a “chalk rag.”</p>

<p>The true and legitimate way of making up is to study
character, that is, seek out a person like whom you wish
to make up, mark down the wrinkles, etc., and then spend
a short time before your glass practicing until you are
perfect.</p>

<p>This will prove the surest and the truest teacher.</p>

<h2><a name="EXPRESSION" id="EXPRESSION">EXPRESSION.</a></h2>


<p>Expression of the face, form and voice is the main point
in acting. The former two may easily be acquired, but
the latter will be utterly ruined if the student places himself
under the tutorship of an elocutionist. They teach a
drawly, too-perfect, sound of every vowel, which is both
harsh and unnatural, and above all, the student is as apt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to copy their faults as their perfections. Seek to imitate
no one&mdash;be something original&mdash;create the parts you
play!</p>

<p>In expressing <em>grief</em>, the head is bent down, the eyes
partially closed, the mouth slightly open, the corners tightly
drawn down, the left hand is pressed upon the heart,
and the right clenched at the side.</p>

<p><em>Fear</em> bends the body forward slightly, the wide open
hands are held up before the face, which is half averted,
the eyes turned to the object of terror. The lower jaw is
dropped, the eyes wide open, showing the ball to its fullest
extent.</p>

<p><em>Love</em> parts the lips, makes the breathing irregular, the
eyes gaze fondly at the object of affection, but drop confusedly
before hers. A smile wreaths the lips, and the
whole demeanor is gentle and tender.</p>

<p><em>Hate</em> protrudes the head, draws rigid the cords of the
neck, shows the eye-balls to their fullest extent, the lower
lip is dropped, showing the tightly-set teeth, the eyebrows
knit with a heavy scowl, and the hands, hanging by the
sides, open and close with a convulsive movement, as if
longing to grip the object of hatred.</p>

<p><em>Jealousy</em> is hate subdued and less forcible, with a nervous
twitching of the lips.</p>

<p><em>Pity</em> clasps the hands, closes the lips in a half pout,
drops the head slightly to the left, and gazes longingly
from beneath the brows.</p>

<p><em>Joy</em> opens the lips, radiates the face with a smile, widens
the eyes, and extends the hands eagerly.</p>

<p><em>Passion</em> contracts the brows, dilates the nostrils, draws
the lips tightly together, and flushes the face. Some practice
will be needed before the rise and fall of color can be
completely mastered, however. The body in this emotion
is drawn fully up, and towers over the object of its rage,
while the hands, as in <em>hate</em>, open and close with a convulsive
grip.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_9"></a><em>Hope</em> is like <em>love</em>, but subdued.</p>

<h2><a name="STAGE_FALLS" id="STAGE_FALLS">STAGE FALLS.</a></h2>


<p>One of the most artistic and catching points with an
audience, is that of falling properly.</p>

<p>Do not rise upon your toes when falling, but keep the
feet tightly together, let the body drop over to the left
side, throw up the arms, put back the head, and break the
fall with the palms of the hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not put out the knee to break it as it ruins the effect
of the fall, and is apt to cause injury, if not a lifetime
lameness, by maiming the knee-cap.</p>

<p>I would not advise the young student to try a back fall,
for few actors in a life-long practice can master the art of

<p>This, perhaps, is one of the hardest tasks in an amateur
organization, but the company must possess, as in a legitimate
theater, its leading man, leading lady, walking gent,
walking lady, responsible man, utility soubrette, to whom
belongs the female comedy parts, (the soubrette is often
called the “chamber-maid,” as her parts usually are of
that sort), low comedian, juvenile man, juvenile lady,
etc., and to these the stage manager should assign the
parts coming <em>in their line only</em>.</p>

<p>Order should be strictly enforced.</p>

<p>Allow no grumbling for better parts&mdash;make it a thorough
business organization.</p>

<p>In this way only can a creditable performance be
brought about.</p>

<p>You may, if you choose, give a dance after the performance,
and send your audience home well pleased with the
night’s entertainment.</p>

<p>With strict adherence to the things set down in this
work, I have no doubt but that from the latent talent in
private circles, may yet spring up actors and actresses
who shall be a credit to that mimic world, that mirror of
nature&mdash;the stage.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_SCENE_PLOT" id="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_SCENE_PLOT">HOW TO MAKE A SCENE PLOT.</a></h2>


<p>In explanation of the terms hereinafter used, it will be
necessary to inform the student of their uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cleets” are little niches put on walls, etc., to facilitate
climbing. A “brace” is a long wooden implement having
a hook on one end and a circular hole at the other. These
are used to sustain the vases in my lady’s garden, or to
steady the rocks in the mountain haunt of the bloodthirsty
robber who dares to defy the law.</p>

<p>The “Traveler” is a truck of wood and iron, elevated
some distance above the borders, and works in a grooved
receiver. By this means, and the aid of stout wires,
fairies and demons are enabled to flit hurriedly through
the air from side to side, and the stout tree the wood-man
fells, to fall gracefully and naturally to the earth.</p>

<p>“The grooves” receive the flats and wings, and are all
numbered, so that when your plot calls for a scene in 1,
the stage carpenter at once knows that you mean one down
by the footlights, which will enable them to set the one
behind ready to draw off at the proper cue. The entrances
between these grooves are all numbered as <em>R.</em> 1 <em>E.</em>, <em>R.</em> 2 <em>E.</em>,
<em>R. U. E.</em>, etc., which means Right first entrance, Right
second entrance, and Right upper entrance; if left remove
the “<em>R</em>” and place “<em>L</em>” in its place. <em>D. F.</em> means door in
flat. Prac. means practicable&mdash;that which is used like a
door or window. If we wish a house on the right side we
simply put, set house <em>R.</em>; if a bridge for characters to
cross from <em>R</em> to <em>L</em> and come down on stage <em>L.</em>, you should
write: “Steps and platform <em>R. U. E.</em> xing (crossing) to
<em>L. U. E.</em> and masked in by bridge with return <em>L.</em>
masked in.” “The Tormentors” are the first wings near
the proscenium, and are usually painted to represent pillars
of marble draped with heavy curtains. They are furnished
with a swinging piece, which may shut off all view
of the stage from the actors in the wings, and thus derive
their name.</p>

<p>After this explanation, I think I may venture to give a
diagram of a scene plot.</p>

<p>And so on each act is marked. Where there are no sets,
place a mark as in diagram on page following, thus &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_PROPERTY-PLOT" id="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_PROPERTY-PLOT">HOW TO MAKE A PROPERTY-PLOT.</a></h2>


<p>Making out a property plot is much the same as making
a scene plot. The number of each act and scene is
placed upon it, as well as the aids props, and the relative
positions of larger ones, as follows:</p>

<div id="Ref_13" class="center">
<table class="toc" style="border-collapse:collapse" rules="cols" border="2" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" summary="PROPS">
<tr><td class="tabtitlecenter" colspan="2">“BLACK SLAYER.”</td></tr>
<tr style="border-bottom:0.1em solid black"><td class="tabtitlecenter" colspan="2">PROPS.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tabtitlecenter">1.</td><td class="tabtitle"><span class="paddedleft">Purse for Ronaldo. Flagon and cups in set house <em>R.</em> Bank <em>L.</em> covered with buffalo skin.</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tabtitlecenter"></td><td class="tabtitlecenter">CURTAIN.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The end of each act is marked by the word “curtain,”
but nothing at the end of the scene.</p>

<p>The property man fashions everything, from a toothpick
to an elephant. If the heavy villain is to throw himself
carelessly upon a couch of skins, it is the property
man’s duty to see that it is there. Again, should the
guards of my lord, the duke, close around him, and protect
him from the onslaught of the ruffians who are attacking
him, the property man fashions the spears they
use, and to him should they be returned at the end of the
play.</p>

<h2><a name="CHOOSING_PLAYS" id="CHOOSING_PLAYS">CHOOSING PLAYS.</a></h2>


<p>In choosing plays, do not at first take those which call
for extensive stage setting and strong acting; rather let
your first efforts be confined to those of a lighter character;
say, for instance, farces, commediettas and one-act
dramas. A pretty little play for home performances, and
one that can be done without scenery, is Simpson’s
“Dreams of Delusion.” I might also suggest such farces
as “Turn Him Out,” “My Turn Next,” and “Should This
Meet the Eye.”</p>

<p>The prompter holds the book or MSS. during the performance,
and at every rehearsal, following the actors in
their lines, explaining the business to them, and whistling
for the change of scene. When alone, his duty is to make
out the scene and property plot, but when he has an
assistant, it is</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DUTY_OF_THE_CALL-BOY" id="THE_DUTY_OF_THE_CALL-BOY">THE DUTY OF THE CALL-BOY.</a></h2>


<p>The call-boy acquaints the characters of the drama
of the approach of the time when they must appear
upon the stage, and furnishes them with “side-props,” or
properties used in the drama, and not found upon the
stage. Such things as rings, vials, daggers, notes, and
side props, as they are carried on. Half an hour before the
time for ringing up the curtain, the call-boy descends to
the dressing-rooms and shouts:</p>

<p>“Half-hour!”</p>

<p>At a quarter of eight he again descends and announces:</p>

<p>“Fifteen minutes!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes after he makes the first call, which for “Romeo
and Juliet” would be:</p>

<p>“No. 1:</p>

<p>“Sampson, Gregory, Abram, Balthasar, Benvolio, Tybalt,
Montague, Capulet, Supers, etc. First act; everybody
up to begin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus is the call-boy’s plot made out, and opposite each
name is placed the properties used by that person.</p>

<p>At the final rehearsal all these properties are used, and
the calls made just as at night. In making out a call-boy’s
plot make as follows: If there be but one call during
each act, place the word “act” after call; if for one scene,
the word “scene;” if the person called makes an exit and
reappears, put “twice” after his name, thus:</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> And brother Willy?</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> He’s got a new boarding-house. Free clothes,

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> How awful!</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Youse kin gamble high dat it was. Allus take
youse whisky straight. Den youse know little Edwardo
Pancake, his father works in a laundry, blowing dirt off
of collars?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> Know him well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> He’s in de hospital. All three of his arms broke
off, backbone knocked clear up into his mouth, and he
can’t chew.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> You don’t say, Billy?</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Yes, I do. I wouldn’t tell a lie for less than a
dollar. Poor Edwardo’s all broke up. They’ve got him
gummed together with mucilage, and it makes him awful
stuck up, won’t notice anybody. But he’s in a bad way.
His little sister came in and called him a liar yesterday,
and he only had animation enough to kick one of her teeth
out.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> How did it happen, Billy? What hurt him?</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Youse see, he borrowed de meat-knife to clean his
nails with. He soon got tired ob dat, an’ thought dat he
would carve his monogram on de stern ob his father’s
mule. He tried it! De mule braced right up&mdash;whoosh!&mdash;bang!&mdash;Edwardo
lived in Boston, an’ dey picked him up
in New Orleans.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> Too bad. How is the cow, Billy?</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Ki, didn’t we have fun?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> Lots.</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> ’Member how I used to grab hold ob her tail an’
try fo’ to steer her? Golly, dat was fun.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> You and I used to be great friends.</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Yes, indeedy. I’d neber steal a piece ob sponge-cake
widout I’d lay it on you; we used to slide up hill togedder,
play rock on a duck, shinny on you own side, let
her fly, an’ all de other games. Tell you what, youse folks
were powerful disappointed, cos I wouldn’t hab youse.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> Why, Billy!</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Dat’s so. But say, Mattie, how much did de
chance cost?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> What chance?</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> De chance at de raffle, dat you drew de riddle
dat’s gone out to juggle wid de sandwiches!</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> I know it. One ob de kind dat come done up in

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> But maybe I might have married better.</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Ob course; me, for example.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> Nonsense&mdash;now there was Captain Charley.</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> I remember him. Used to wear his nose in joints,
and had his hair cracked in the middle. Nice gemmen.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> He was that, Billy. I should like to see him
again.</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> So would the boss ob de hash-house where he
boarded. Captain skipped, and nebber paid a cent.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> But he loved me, Billy.</p>

<p><em>Billy.</em> Ob course&mdash;it’s catching.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. S.</em> And he would come and sit on the sofa by me,
same as we are sitting.</p>

<p class="center largefont">A Burlesque German Stump Speech.</p>

<p class="center">BY LARRY TOOLEY.</p>

<p>Mine Frendts:&mdash;At the earnest solicidation of several
frendts of mine, now in states brison, I have succeeded in
getting permission to afflict you mid dis lecdure. Dis lecdure
vos written while I was demporarily insane, and consequently
everyding indo it vos displeasing.</p>

<p>The subject which I haf chosen is Lofe. As the poet
says, “Lofe&mdash;lofe! oh, vot vos lofe?” Id is a conundrum.
My exberience of lofe&mdash;my brudder vos engaged seventeen
dimes&mdash;deaches me dat it vos someding in dis style.</p>

<p>Before you vos spliced your girl throws pop-corn balls at
you, and calls you “Daisy.” After you vos spliced she does
the same ding; except dat she uses stones und flad-irons instead
of pop-corn balls, und calls you “Devil.”</p>

<p>But lofe vos nice.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, vot can be nicer than to dake your girl oud for a
ride in a piano truck and visper tales of agony amongst her
back hair. Und den you dell her dat she lofes some other
feller better than she does yourself, and haf her tell you
dat yot vos a liar. Oh, dat vos bully.</p>

<p>Courting, dough, dat is the best dime of a young man’s
life.</p>

<p>Dot vos de period ven he puts herosene oil mit his hair,
gets his collar vhite-vashed, ties his father’s suspender
around his neck for a gravat, und polishes up his rubber
boots mit stove-placking.</p>

<p>Den he goes out to mash his girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>She has been leaning out of the garret vinder vatching
for him for most of the afternoon, but as soon as she sees
him come around the corner she goes down to the door, is
much surprised to see him, und gifs him liquorice to de effect
dat she didn’t expect him for the next six weeks, und
vos shust coming oud to see dat somebody didn’t sdeal the
sdoop.</p>

<p>Then you go into the parlor und dake a seat on the mantel
piece, und you ax her vos her fader sick, vhether her
mother had the group yet, how long before her brudder
vould come off the island, und so forth.</p>

<p>Den you carelessly insert your hand into your pocked und
ask her does she like rock candy.</p>

<p>She smiles und says yes.</p>

<p>Den you dell her you know vhere there vos a store vhere
dey keep pully rock candy, und den you pull avay your
hand from oud of your pockeds mit a cigar in it, und light
it.</p>

<p>She don’t see the joke und gets mad und goes avay to the
other end of the beer saloon, vhile you dink vot a funny
cuss you vos.</p>

<p>By-und-by she says dat she expegts other company; dat
dere vos a young man who vos rich und owned two chicken-houses
in Hobogen vos coming to see her, und dat if
dere vos anybody dat vanted to see you, you had petter
not keep dem waiting.</p>

<p>Den you get mad.</p>

<p>You dell her dat dere vos sixdeen young ladies dat vos
dying because you von’t speak mit dem, und dat you von’t
come into her old house again if it vos to be struck mit
thunder. After dat you get up und valk like a funeral towards
the door.</p>

<p>Dat fetches her.</p>

<p>She casts a glance at you und asks vhere you vos going,
und you rebly dat you vos going to drown yourself, or else
go ’round und pick up anodder mash.</p>

<p>She looks sad und remarks oud of the vinder dat you
don’t lofe her, but vos only playing her for a flat.</p>

<p>You say it vos a lie, und say dat you lofe her so much dat
you could pawn her vooden sleeves-buttons to buy yourself
a Christmas present mit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Den she gets up und flies to your arms, und by-und-by
you take her around the corner and hang up the Italian for
one plate of cream mit two spoons. Ah, dat vos de panorama
of lofe.</p>

<p>Let me say, my fellow drunkard, dat a veller who marries
a girl for her money is a scoundhrel, I vould villingly
be a scoundhrel mineself, did opportunity permit.</p>

<p>A man should lofe a girl for herself not for her relations,
und if she was born an orphan or her parents vos avay at
her birth, so much the better.</p>

<p>Den when summer time comes he von’t haf to cart his
vife, und her sister, und her mother, und her bruther dat
vos out of vork, to the country, und haf the pleasure of
paying all the bills.</p>

<p>Lofe it vos a funny ting.</p>

<p>Lofe vas vot makes a young man of America git six dollars
a veek und spend seven of it in buying collars. Lofe
is vot makes him feel dat his face vos never clean, dat his
pants vas busted behind und dat his feet are the size of
tea chests.</p>

<p>Lofe is vot makes him clean his teeth mit the shoe-brush
twelve dimes a day, und wear a coffe-rose mit his button-hole
every dime dat he passes his sweedheart’s door.</p>

<p>But de vorst of lofe is ven id turns oud der best. Dat
ish to say, ven you ged married.</p>

<p>It vas nice to be a fader, some grazyman remarked, but
I don’d see id. Maybe it vos peyewtiful to dake de smallest
kid up mit your arms, und haf him tickle you under de
chin as innocent as a fall sheep, und den, five minutes
lader, draw picters all over your new glean shird mit de
gravy-spoon. Some folks may like dat, but as for me, I
pass id every dime.</p>

<p>But ven de children ingrease, two or dree at a dime, den
de picnic begins. How nice id vos to ged up in de nighd
mit de dwins, und valk aroundt de plock mit dem, in your
nighd shird, to keeb dem from keebing avake. Dat is vot
makes murderers oud of men.</p>

<p>But I dink dat I must conglude. I am a married man,
und&mdash;vell, my vife keebs de nighd-key, I might lose id,
und&mdash;vell, however, those of you who are married men,
know how id vos yourselves, don’d id?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Thanking you all for the very kind vay in vich you haf
been baying attention to someding else during my remarks,
I conglude, hoping to come before you mit a new
lecture before long.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> See here, Alonzo.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Shout away.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Don’t you play that on me again.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Play what?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> French brandy, twenty-five cents a glass. Do
you take me for the mint?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> You said to take what I wanted.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Spozen you wanted the whole saloon, would
you took that? Hereafter, when you drink with me&mdash;lager,
five cents.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> All right. [<em>Laughs as if a thought had just
struck him.</em>] See here, Augustus, I want to see you privately
a minute. Gentlemen, excuse us.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy and Alph.</em> Oh, certainly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>[Alonzo <em>takes</em> Augustus <em>to one side of stage</em>. Stumpy
<em>and</em> Alphonso <em>engage in conversation inaudibly at back</em>.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> You know Charlie Gilsey, Augustus?</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Charlie Gilsey, that belongs to our club?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Yes.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> I know him well&mdash;he owes me a dollar.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Well, Charlie went on a regular old hurrah, the
other night. Got blind drunk, stole door-knobs and area
gates, and he got run in by the cops. Took him to the
Tombs to await his trial. You see, it was an awful disgrace.
Charlie is one of the first families, when all the
rest are out of town, and it drove him off of his center.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Did what?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Sent him lending out brains. Made him crazy.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Poor fellow!</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Oh, it was tough. Well, you know the warden
liked Charlie; used to grub him good. No use, Charlie
wouldn’t eat anything. Just the other day he sent a
waiter up with a tray of broiled chicken.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Broiled chicken! oh, yum!</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Yes, broiled chicken, with grape sauce. Charlie
ups and kicks the tray clean out of the waiter’s hands.
Then he went for the waiter, hit him under the ear, jumped
on him, and so on. The waiter couldn’t stand it.
What do you suppose he did?</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Hit him, <em>so</em>. [<em>Slaps</em> Augustus’ <em>face</em>, Augustus
<em>staggers back</em>. Alonzo <em>cocks hat over his eyes, and struts
around stage</em>.]</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> ’Nother fellow sold! [<em>Laughs.</em></p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Bully joke!</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Yah&mdash;yah&mdash;yah! You never tumbled.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> I say, does that skeleton of Coney Island know
anything about this?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Then watch me slug him. [<em>Walks back and taps</em>
Alphonso <em>on the shoulder</em>.] I’d like to see you for a moment,
Alphonso; excuse him, Stumpy.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Oh, yes, tell him not to hurry back.</p>

<p>[Augustus <em>and</em> Alphonso <em>walk over to front of stage</em>.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> You know Charlie Gilsey?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Well; my mother washes for him.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> The other night Charlie went out on a corker.
Got full of jig-water, felt uproarious, went around and
stole a lot of front doors and two or three sidewalks. By-and-by
the police caught him, locked him up in the Tombs.
The disgrace drove Charlie cranky.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Cranky!</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Yes, he went off of his caboose.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Oh, crazy.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Crazy’s the word. Now you know Charlie saw the
warden, and the warden treated Charlie kindly. Yesterday
he sent a waiter up to Charlie with an Erie Canal shad
on a tray; Charlie up and kicked the tray out of the waiter’s
hand, and then he began to abuse the waiter; of course
the waiter wouldn’t stand that, and what do you suppose
that he done?</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Biffed him&mdash;so! [<em>Hits</em> Alphonso <em>a blow on the
cheek</em>. <em>Biz of strutting around by</em> Augustus.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> He bit like a fish. I guess I’ve broke his jaw.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Deuced nice story.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Funny, ain’t it?</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Awful; but say, old fellow.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Has the East river ghost heard anything of this?</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> Not a volume.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Then view me paralyze him. (<em>Walks over to</em>
Stumpy.) Say, Stumpy, I’ve got a funny story to tell you.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> What about?</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Charlie Gilsey. You know Charlie?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Oh, yes, he’s one of Bricktop’s pals.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Well, this is a bully story. Make you laugh till
you cry.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> All right, I want to laugh. Spit her out.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> You see Charlie went on a jamboree the other
night; got full as a goat on corn rock and whisky. He
stole half a dozen hand-carts and a grocery store, and the
police collared him. Poor Charlie was locked up in the
Tombs. You know he was always awful sensitive.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Oh, awful! You never had to call him a liar
over six times before he would ask you what you meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Well, the disgrace of the thing muddled his brain
box.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Sorter give him the jim-jams in his head.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Just so. But the warden was a friend of his, and
tried to do all he could for him. Yesterday he sent a waiter
up with a pickled ham on a tray for Charlie. Charlie
ups and kicks it off. What do you suppose the waiter
did?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Eat the ham.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> No; he slugged Charlie, so. (<em>Hits</em> Stumpy. <em>Same
biz as before.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Caught him again. I must have broke his ear.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Tell me some more; real nice story.</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> Grand joke, ain’t it?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Immense; but say, Hannah Rothschild, does
that bald-headed child-killer over there know the racket?</p>

<p><em>Alph.</em> No; I’ve given it to you first.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Oh, ho! Strawberries and cream. Gaze upon
me part his hair. (<em>Walks over to</em> Alonzo.) Say, old
Morgue, I want to see you for five or six years.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> What for?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> You know Charlie Gilsey?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Charlie Gilsey, the alderman’s niece?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> That’s the cake.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Oh, I know him well.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> I’ve got a tip-top joke to give you about him.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> You don’t say.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Sure. You see Charlie got off on a screecher
last week. Got crammed full of bottle-stuffing. Oh, he
got as drunk as a senator. He went on a racket and stole
a hotel and an elevated railroad and a freight car, and
some little things like that. He got arrested. Judge
made it two years. It broke Charlie’s heart. He wasn’t
used to getting more than six months at a time, and he
got rats in his garret.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Did what?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Went off his nut&mdash;crazy.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Ah, I see.</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> You see, the warden was a friend of his,
and he tried to do all that he could for poor Charlie.
Bought a piano and a washing machine, and furnished up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
his room elegantly. Didn’t do any good. Charlie kept
crazy. Yesterday the warden sent a waiter up with a
tray containing a whole hog and some custard pie, and
stewed whale, and some more little delicacies. Charlie up
and kicked the waiter out of the tray’s hand.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Go ’way!</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> It’s so. But worse yet&mdash;Charlie went for the
waiter.</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Went for the waiter?</p>

<p><em>Stumpy.</em> Terrible case. Hit him with the piano, jumped
on his nose&mdash;oh, raised the devil. And what do you
suppose the waiter did in return?</p>

<p><em>Alon.</em> Struck him&mdash;so! [<em>Raps</em> Stumpy <em>on the face and
knocks him over. All of the other characters go for</em>
Stumpy <em>and knock him around the stage. Flats close on
general melee.</em></p>

“Hon. Bernard McFlynn&mdash;Sir, in appreciation of your services

once (<em>starting off.</em>).</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> (<em>Calling him.</em>) How long will you be gone, Bernard?
you know we have nothing to eat in the house, and
little Johnny Morrissey has grown hump-back from the

<p><em>Ber.</em> When I return from the City Hall, Ellen, we will
hold an investigation as to the sanitary condition of the

<p>[<em>Enter</em> Landlord.]</p>

<p><em>Land.</em> Mrs. McFlynn, this is the last time I will call on

to leave.</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Leave, is it? Sure and it’s that same thing we
intend to do. And it’s not heard you have of the position

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Sure and he has been elected Engineer of the

dirty hovel and move up on Lexicon avenue in the morning.
Now, Mr. O’Grady, put that in your pipe and smoke
it.</p>

After a while you will be wanting plum pudding, or poie

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Oh, Bernard, sure and the baby can’t help it;
don’t be so cross, and eat your supper, that’s a good man.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Supper, is it? And what have you got for supper?</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Well, I’ve got some nice pork, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> (<em>Excitedly.</em>) Ellen, do you think I’m a sausage machine,
to be grinding up pork every day? No, Mrs. McFlynn,
I’ll not do it!</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Well, what would you like? How would some
canary bird eyes and pigeon milk suit you? Or would you
rather have a bird of paradise on toast?</p>

<p>[<em>Sits at table.</em></p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Don’t be so kleptomaniac in your remarks. I’ll have
that bottle a little more on my side of the table.</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Sure, and it’s my money that bought it, and I’ll
keep it where it is.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Ho, ho! You’re standing on your high horse to-day.
I suppose before long you’ll be wanting to celebrate
your golden wedding, or silver wedding, and be bringing
all your poor relations here to live on me.</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> Sure, an’ not one of my relations ever asked a
thing of you, and as to my celebrating my golden wedding,
or silver wedding, or whatever you call it, I celebrated
my wooden wedding when I married a <em>block head</em>,
do you mind that now?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Ellen, if you cast any more of your conflections on
me I’ll brain you with this pitcher.</p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> (<em>Jumps up.</em>) Well, I guess not, says Timothy
Conner; I’m boss of this house and I’ll do as I like. Sure
it was my political influence that got your position, and
I’ll have you dismissed with impunity.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Ellen, the dignity of my position will not allow me
to quarrel with a woman; but if you say another word,
I’ll knock you down with the stove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Ellen.</em> (<em>Crying.</em>) That’s right; go on&mdash;cry out so Mrs.
McGillan and the folks on the top flure can hear you. If
my cousin Terrence was here he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> (<em>Jumps up, overturns table, etc.</em>) Terrence, is it?
the mean, dirty blackguard, I’d&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>McSwegan.</em> Well, I have just come into town to meet
an old friend of mine from the same place in Ireland as
myself; but he has risen in the world, and keeps a lager
beer brewery in Koekuk, Iowa. I don’t see him, so I will
step down to McNally’s saloon. Probably he will come
along while I am gone. [<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p><em>Enter</em> Crossin.</p>

<p><em>Crossin.</em> I wonder where McSwegan is? He promised
to meet me here. As I was coming around the corner a
little girl looked at me in the face, and says: “There’s
General Grant.” I looked around and says: “You lie,

<p><em>Cros.</em> Good-afternoon.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> What kept you so quick?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> I couldn’t come any later.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> Have you had any trouble lately at your home?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Yes, we had a railroad accident.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> I didn’t hear anything about it. What was it?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Mary Ann O’Brien hung herself with her back
hair.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> How do you make that out a railroad accident?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Why, her death was caused by a misplaced
switch.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> It’s a wonder they didn’t put you up for a headlight.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> If I had your mouth we might have used it for a
tunnel.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> Well, are you working now?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> No; I have not worked for three months.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> I can get you a fine job.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> What doing?</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> Why, a friend of mine wants to put you in an envelope;
he wants to send a valentine to a shoemaker.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Say, when you go home you want to eat all the
salt you can get; you are the freshest rooster I ever saw.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> Well, if you don’t like that job, put molasses on
your whiskers, and hire yourself out for fly paper.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Will you be doing anything to-morrow?</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> No, I guess not. Why?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Well, I would like to have you come with me to a

<p><em>McS.</em> What do you want with my picture?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> I want to give it to the police. I lost my monkey.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> No; what is it?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> It’s all over town.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Mud.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> That’s a very good joke.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> No, not at present.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> I see the mud has covered them up.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> See here, do you know any conundrums?</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> I mean do you know anything I ought to give up?</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> You ought to give up them two dollars you owe
me.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Well, ask me some conundrum.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> All right. Which is the best way to make fish-balls
without the fish?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Why, send the potatoes home C. O. D. What
looks most like the half moon?</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> Why, the other half.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Why is the mosquito a good poker player?</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> Because every time he draws he fills.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Well, what chance have I got? Ask me one.</p>

<p><em>McS.</em> All right. Which is the best way to keep a dog
from going mad in August?</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> Shoot him in July.</p>

<p><em>Cros.</em> All right. Why are your two feet like an Italian

<p><em>McS.</em> I will give it up. Why are your two feet like an

he wants to get on the other side. Why didn’t you

<h2><a name="TEMPERANCE" id="TEMPERANCE">TEMPERANCE.</a></h2>


<p class="center largefont">A Dutch Declamation.</p>

<p class="center">BY GUS WILLIAMS.</p>

<p>I haf been unvited dis evening, fellow drunkards, to
speak to you on de subject of demperance, by a large majority
of demperance men who never drink&mdash;unless dey vos
asked.</p>

<p>I didn’t used to be a demperance man myself vonce. I
vos a hard case, and used to go into a beer saloon, rap
against my umbrella mit de gounter, und holler oud: “Gif
me a lemonade straight&mdash;mid no water.”</p>

<p>But I haf seen de error of my vays.</p>

<p>Von night ven I vas in a hodel, swigging down cider und
vichy, and German seltzer, und all of dose thoroughbred
drinks, und hafing lods of fun mit de gang, a gentleman
come ub to me.</p>

<p>He vos aboud half full, und dere vos a tear as big as a
balloon on de end of his nose as he caught me by de throat,
und whispered:</p>

<p>“I vant to see you alone for aboud a veek.”</p>

<p>I said “all righd,” and he took me to one gorner of de
room, and said:</p>

<p>“You vos a nice young man.”</p>

<p>I dold him he vos kerrect, dot vos vhat all de spielers
said&mdash;dey said dot I vos too sweet to live.</p>

<p>“It vos a shame,” he continued, mit emotion und beer
in his voice, “to see you ruining of yourself mit lemonade
and such shadows of strong drinks.”</p>

<p>I said dot I guessed so too.</p>

<p>“Vell,” he remarked, und he squeezed de punions on my
hands, “swear off!&mdash;drink only vhiskey and Old Tom gin.”</p>

<p>I schwore.</p>

<p>From dis day to dot I haf been a changed man; I never
get sober ofer dree dimes a week&mdash;agate measure.</p>

<p>Oh, I give it to you straight, my hearers, demperance
vos a great ding&mdash;for women and children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>I had a brudder vonce, a goot, nice, six for a penny leedle
poy. He had hair like roasted cheese und a complexion
like strawberries mit gream gakes. Ve all dought dat he
vould grow ub to pe bresident of a pank, skib avay to Canada
und end his days universally respected.</p>

<p>But he vos led astray.</p>

<p>He got in mit an alderman’s son und a minister’s daughter,
und dot ruined him.</p>

<p>He vos goaxed to drink.</p>

<p>Fust vater mit orange peel, den soda vater, next veiss
peer mit a glub in it, after dot, brandy.</p>

<p>Ve dried to stop him in his vild career, but it vos N. G.&mdash;no
use.</p>

<p>He vould come home newsbaber drunk efery night, und
addract a growd around the house mit his antics, und dere
vosn’t a slate in the neighborhood dot didn’t pear his autograph.</p>

<p>Und where is he now?</p>

<p>I repeat it to blush.</p>

<p>He is a congressman, und dey dalk of running him for
bresident.</p>

<p>Und his poor mother, she is going to die of a broken
heart shust as soon as she can find dime.</p>

<p>It vos a noble poet who remarked; “Look de udder vay
at de lager ven it vas vhite.”</p>

<p>He vos righd.</p>

<p>Alvays let de lager settle; too much white und not
enough red always spoils a schooner.</p>

<p>I am glad to say dot my demperance lectures haf not
been mitout dere effect.</p>

<p>In von town vere I lectured dere vos only von liquor
seller.</p>

<p>Now dere is six!</p>

<p>It is such driumphs as dis vich haf made me vot I used
to be; de greatest terrible example of dem all.</p>

<p>De udder night at a social party, I met a young man mit
de bloom of youth&mdash;fifty cents a bottle&mdash;on his cheek.</p>

<p>He vos de drunkest man I efer saw; in fact, he vos so
drunk dot he dook me for a gentleman, and asked me
vould I haf someding.</p>

<p>I said “No!”&mdash;I vas full already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Den I dook him around to a lamp-post on de next plock
und gave him taffy like a step-father.</p>

<p>“My friend,” I said, “you haf a mother?”</p>

<p>He replied dot dere vos a tradition to dot effect.</p>

<p>“Vell,” I recommenced, “vot vould your mother gif to
see you in this condition?”</p>

<p>“She vould gif six dousand dollars,” he sobbed.</p>

<p>“Vot, to see you staggering?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she vos blind from her birth.”</p>

<p>Dot settled it&mdash;dot is to say, it settled dot branch of de
subject&mdash;but I vent for him on de demperance issue pald-headed.</p>

<p>He realized dot I vos not in fun, and he signed de pledge
never to use liquor, except as a beverage, until he died&mdash;or
got married.</p>

<p>He has kept his word&mdash;it is aboud all he has to keep now&mdash;und
is now employed by the city as a plumber for de
bird houses in de Central Bark.</p>

<p>But von thing I must speak on before I gonclude.</p>

<p>It vos about de ladies.</p>

<p>It is hard to resist de demptation to drink; not many
haf de courage like I haf, nefer to refuse.</p>

<p>But it is specially hard for a young man to refuse, when
a young and lovely lady presents a tomato-can full of Pilsener
and sweetly says:</p>

<p>“Take a bath, George?”</p>

<p>But I must end.</p>

<p>My fire-insurance policy runs out to-night, und I wish to
escape mit my life.</p>

<p>In conclusion let me say, never drink, young man, never
drink&mdash;<em>alone</em>!</p>

to arrive. But she’s late to-night. Shure, since she’s
been workin’ in the playin’ card factory it’s too high-toned
she has become to ride up town on the horse-car. It is on
the back balcony av a truck that she rowls along. Hark,
I guess that that is her footstep now. [<em>Listens.</em></p>

hard working girl, ain’t it?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> That’ll do, miss. Perhaps yez would like charlotty
ruse and banana fritters wid egg sauce. Any girl that
don’t like ham and crackers is too fastidious to live.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Well, I don’t care; all the other girls have nice

<p><em>Brid.</em> Yez want to go to the Hoolihan massacree ball?
Divil a step do you stir there to-night. No daughter av
mine shall go to a massacree ball and dance wid five-cent

<p><em>Mary.</em> But I want to go awful bad. All the boys and

<p><em>Brid.</em> Yis; an’ the police will take thim in. Where is

<p><em>Mary.</em> No, ma’am, at Wulhalla Hall.</p>

Burns is a foine young man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Of course he is; he’s a masher.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> I’ll mash his head if he comes foolin’ around here.
A feller that wears a soup dish hat and a pickadilly collar,
and wears a bunch of asparagus in his button-hole. Begorra,
Mary Ann, next yez will be asking me to allow yez

<p><em>Mary.</em> Sure he meant it as a compliment.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Oh, he did, did he?</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Yis, and he said that he couldn’t tell you from

[<em>Takes off ragged coat and dons linen duster much

<p><em>Brid.</em> Are yez hungry, ould man?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Hungry! Be Heaven, I could ate a plate ov mortar!
What have yez for supper?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Corn beef and cabbage.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Corn beef and cabbage.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Yis.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Woman, you’ll drive me mad. Corn beef and cabbage
is nice food for a hard working man. Why don’t yez
have ice cream and pie?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Where’s the money to get it wid?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Buy a lottery ticket, me daisy. Bridget O’Rielly,
if I come home to-morrow night and find corn beef and
cabbage for supper I’ll slaughter yez.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Dad, why don’t you buy a new dicer?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Do what?</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Strike a fresh kady.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Mary Ann, I wasn’t brought up in Frinch. Did that
horse car conductor that sint yez the boquet av peetoonias
larn ye the articulation? Yez’ll be settin’ up a Vienna Bakery
next.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Oh, you can’t tumble for a cent. Why don’t you
get a new hat?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> A new hat! What’s the matter wid this? [<em>Takes
off a battered stovepipe</em>.] I’ve only worn it seventeen years.
Next yez will be axin me to purchase a pair av low-necked
shoes, and some giddy socks.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> That hat looks as if it was called in. Get a gun
and shoot it.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> I’ll get a cannon and stab you. Bridget, is the corn
beef and cabbage ripe?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Shure it is. Come take your sates at the table.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Bernard O’Rielly, are ye mad?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> No, I’m insane. The next time ye buy bread, Bridget,
see that it isn’t stuffed wid bricks. I’ve left three of
me teeth in the loaf.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Shure, it’s good.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Good for pavin the streets. If the Czar of Rushia
had had cannon balls as hard as that bread, he’d a licked
the bloody Turks long ago.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Thin I’ll throw it away.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> No, yez won’t. Save it, and I’ll kill a cat wid it.
Pass me the butter.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> The butter’s strong enough to walk to ye.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> No criticisms, young leddy; if the butter’s good
enough for yer ancistor, it is good enough for yez. What
are ye all dressed up fur to-night?</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> I’m going to a ball.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> The Hoolihan’s masquerade ball.</p>

bury Pat McGinness, if she wants relaxation. Who was
she goin’ to the ball wid?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Denny Burns.</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> A young thafe that gets fifty cints a week playin’
policy. Mary Ann, if I catch that hypothecation around
this chateau, I’ll break his neek, do you savvy?</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Then I can’t go wid him?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> No, me leddy. Stay at home and read yez hymn-book,

when the time comes for the torch-light picnics. Bridget,
take off this overdress of mine, and bring me me spring

whin I come back I’ll kill yez both. Do yez moind?</p>

<p>[<em>Exit</em> Bernard. Mary <em>and</em> Bridget <em>both get up from the

<p><em>Mary.</em> Oh, father’s an ould stick-in-the-mud. He can’t
boss me.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> He’ll paralyze every sinew in your body.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> I ain’t afraid. If he tries any of his lugs on me
Denny will put a head on him. Da&mdash;da, mother.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> If yez get killed at the ball it ain’t my fault.</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> All right. Over the sewer, skip the gutter, cross
the river, mother. [<em>Exit at door.</em></p>

to the system. Bridget&mdash;Bridget! wake up, or I’ll
kick your eyes open.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> (<em>Getting up from cot.</em>) What’s the matter?
Where’s the fire?</p>

where’s the ax? Give it to me till I chop the
assassin up!</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Yez are givin’ it ter me straight. Did yer see me
mash that son of cross-eyed McCarty for saying that yez
had a foot like a giraffe?</p>

<p><em>Mary.</em> Did you kill him?</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> No; but I broke the sucker’s jaw. Where are the

him, Bernard.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> What’s this, anyhow?</p>

<p><em>Ber.</em> Young man, yez have alluded disrespectfully to

In de fus place, fustly, dis little nigga’s head am like

call de bump of combativeness; under dat bump dere is a
large bladder ob dandriff, and when de nigga gets a little
’zaggerated, de bladder splodes; de cold air rushes into de

<p><em>Bridget.</em> Shure, an’ it’s the terrible loife I’m lading.
There’s me husband, Patrick Grady, always off av a night
to Casey’s, getting blind drunk, an’ rowling an’ cavortin’
a home in the morning, a swearing that he’s in wid the
gang, an’ that they’re goin’ for to run him for alderman.
A foine alderman it is that he will make, with his shirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
paping out av his coat, an’ divil a sock to his fut. Faith,
I belave he’s goin’ ter the bad, intirely. He’s gettin’ so
mighty high chuned av late that he’ll soon be a riding
down town in a stage, instead av standing on the rear end
av a truck. Oh, bad cess to the day that ivir I married
him.</p>

<p>[<em>Enter</em> Denis.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Well, Bridget?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> It isn’t well at all, brother Denis.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Where’s Patrick?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Ax me something aisier. Down to Casey’s, I suppose,
setting on top av a beer keg an’ swaring that he’s
the man that’s going to put Cleveland out av the White
House.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> On a drunk again?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Whin isn’t he on a drunk? Shure I’d be afther
fearing that he was ill if he should come home sober.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> It’s a bad business, Bridget.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Ye are right. Ye see he’s got his head crammed
wid politics.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Politics, is it?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Yis; he went an’ pawned the stove to raise a
banner wid. Shure he thinks that he’ll be Congressman
afore long, an’ ruin the prospects av his childer intirely.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Will he be home soon?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> I’m expecting him every moment. Oh, Denny, I
wish ye would rayson wid him.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> So I will, Bridget. His conduct, be heaven, is
scandalous in the extreme!</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> But don’t be too hard wid him. Patrick manes
well.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> I’ll thrate him dacent. [<em>Aside.</em>] I’ll kick the devil’s
left lung out av him if he gives me any av his unpolite
conversation.</p>

<p>[<em>Noise outside. Enter</em> Patrick, <em>staggering. Throws hat
on floor, and reels front.</em></p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> May I inquire, Missus Grady, who’s a been putting
grease on the front piazzy?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Nobody, Patrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> (<em>Severely.</em>) Don’t yer lie to me, Missus Grady. I
may be suffering undher a fit av despair, but I am not
drunk, and I have me feelings. Shure, an’ I fell complately
down on that front piazzy.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Ye don’t know what ye are saying, Patrick.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> (<em>Looking at</em> Denis.) How long since you have been
buying cigar signs to stick up in your drawing-room, Missus
Grady?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Why, that’s your brother Denis.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> (<em>Advancing.</em>) Faith, an’ it is! Denny, me boy,
give me your flipper. Have ye a Henry Mud consaled wid
you?</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> I don’t smoke.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Yer don’t? Yer a Murphyite, are ye? An’ may I
ax what sent ye here?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> He heard what a drunken husband his sister had,
and he came down to see about it.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Ah&mdash;ha! he did? Well, it’s my opinion, Missus
Grady, that he’s drunk as an owl himself, and isn’t agreeable
company for gintlemin like mesilf.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> I never drink, an’ it would be better, Patrick, if
you never touched the whisky.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Nayther I do. It’s a nob that I am. A gallon bottle
of dam shame, an’ put it down on the slate.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Well, I mane it would be a dale better if ye left
alcoholic stimulants alone.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Alcoholic stimulants, is it? Missus Grady, are ye
aware that yer brother spakes Frinch? It’s the great temperance
man that he is who praches for love an’ not
money.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> But, Patrick, think av the shame it causes your
wife for you to walk home intoxicated every night av your
life.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> I niver walk home. Bedad Assemblyman Murphy
pushed me around to me residence this avening in his
barouche&mdash;he peddles oranges out av it in the daytime.
Ah, the assemblyman’s a great man. He’s got a pull in
the ward, and he’s going to get me a political job a kaping
the sparrows from flying away wid the City Hall.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> But your wife and children are a-starving in the
manewhile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> That’s so, Patrick.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Will yer shut up, Bridget? yer want ice-crame and
sponge cake fer lunch, I suppose. The next thing yer’ll
be sinding out afther broiled quail in a box afther yer get
to bed. It’s too toney, you’re getting, entirely.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Is that the way to spake to your wife?</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Whose wife is she?</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Yours, worse luck; but she’s my sister.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Shure, it wasn’t her fault, poor thing. Perhaps
yer would be plased to have me buy her a pianny an’ get
her a velocipede to amuse herself wid while I’m at work?</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> You’re drunk, Patrick, and yer can’t see me argyment.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> That’s thrue.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Will ye be still, Bridget? I’m drunk, am I, Mister
Hallorahan? Av coorse I am; it’s elated wid joy that I
am, because of the war in Europe. It’s agoin’ to mend the
times in this country, an’ we’ll all git paid for being gentlemen,
every man of us. Oh, I have the head for a senator.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> You’re looney, Pat.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Missus Grady, if ye don’t shut up I’ll be forced to
be on the lookout fur another wife, on account av yer suddent
death.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Patrick, your cruel words will drive me wild with
grief.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Thin we’ll send ye to play Hamlet.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Talk gently to your wife, Pat; she’s a woman.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Yer don’t mane it. Well, did yer imagine I didn’t
know that? I have frequent opportunities av seeing women
afore. There’s Widow Leary, for occasion.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Widdy Leary, she’s a fine crathur! A female skeleton,
that paints herself up like a brick house, an’ hasn’t
the shape av a barrel.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> The Widow Leary recognizes a fine man when she
sees him. She tould Father Riordan that I had the natest
fut av any man for blocks around.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> She did, did she?</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> I’m a givin’ it to ye wid directness, Bridget.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> When I catch her I’ll kill her. Thrying to intice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
me lawful wedded husband away, the cork-legged ould
scarecrow.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> That will do. Ye ought to be elated to think that
ye have sich a voluptuous-appearing husband, and ought
to be continted to humor him, especially whin he’s got
sich influence wid the bys. Do ye know the “Garvey
Musketeers,” Denis?</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Yis.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Shure, they’ve axed me to turn out wid them to
carry their target instead of a nagur. Perhaps yer would
condescind to ax me for a place in the post office now?</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Are ye goin’ to turn out wid those blaggards?</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Don’t yer be after alluding to the Garvey Musketeers
as blaggards, Missus Grady. They are gintlemen;
divil a wan av them works for a living.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> They’re not off av the Island long enough.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Perhaps they are not cheeney enough for yer.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> They’re a lot of rowdies, Pat. Why don’t you join
the Father Matthy’s?</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Would ye hear the woman? she’s putting on frills
enough for an inspector’s wife. Wouldn’t yer like me to
buy meself a little white apron an’ turn out wid the
masons?</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Pat, can’t you listen to rayson?</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Av coorse.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Is it sensible or raysonable for you to be flying
around wid the boys and laving your poor wife at home?
Suppose some man should run off wid her.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Begorra, I’d jump on his chest till he spit blood, so
I would.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Now promise me you’ll stay at home more nights.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> Yes, Pat, do, and jine the T. A. B’s.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Shure, Casey would drape his saloon in black if I
did.</p>

<p><em>Brid.</em> The curse of St. Patrick light on Casey. [<em>She
rises and approaches</em> Pat, <em>tickles him under the chin</em>.]
Then, Patsey, darlint, sign the pledge.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> But it will spoil me hould in the ward. Who ever
heard av a temperance politician.</p>

<p><em>Den.</em> Drop politics an’ stick to bricklaying, Pat.</p>

<p><em>Pat.</em> Well, I believe I will. From this hour Pat Grady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Iskwire, drinks no more! [<em>Aside</em>&mdash;at his own expense.]
Bridget, shoulder that broom an’ we’ll give the leddies an’
jintlemen in front “Sons of Temperance,” T. A. B., and
yer, Denis, jine in the chorus.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
